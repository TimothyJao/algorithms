# learning

Everything that I have worked on and learned during my job search can be found here! I'm constantly looking to further my knowledge in computer science and every new project I work on or technology I learn will be located here.

## leetcode

This section contains all the leetcode questions I have done. I am constantly adding questions as I am doing them!


## react-projects

This section contains a series of simple components that I created using react and react-hooks. React has so many nuances and quirks and I hope to learn all I can.

### Trello

I made a very simple trello code derived from TripleByte's list of MVPs. My main takeaway here is the use of useReducer and how it can manage the state of a component and its sub-components. In addition, I saw the clear difference between container and presentational components.

### Stopwatch

Made a stop watch that had start, stop, reset and lap functionalities. My main takeaway from this project is the importance of the retuned callback from useEffect. That callback is only called if the dependencies array is changed and when the component dismounts.
