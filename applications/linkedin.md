As an ex-hardware engineer, I’ve built systems of all sizes. I’ve worked with the minute in transistors and microcontrollers and the gigantic in spacecraft and robots. Thus, I know the impact each individual component has on the whole. Likewise, I know the importance of understanding how the complete system works before working on its subsystems. I have been able to carry this knowledge into Software Development. My attention to detail is vital in debugging small snippets of code that are integral to my program. I am able to easily pinpoint bugs and errors by isolating specific components and snippets of code, which is a skill I directly transferred from my circuit debugging abilities. I also know the importance of clean and streamlined code. A huge issue in a few of the companies I worked with was the inability to find specific components and parts because of poor practices and storage management which led to hours of wasted time. Because of my experiences, I always aim for cleanliness. A messy program or directory tree can waste the time of all engineers involved. Another one of my strenghts is my ability to see the overeall system and how the component I am working on fits in. At one of my jobs, I was working on a series of pick-and-drop robots. I needed to understand how the motor or controller I was working on would impact how the robot functions. Depending on how fast we wanted the system to run or how much weight it needed pick up, we needed specify the strength of the motor and voltage sent out by the controller. This carries well into software design. Once I identify what I want my system to do, I know how each component should behave in certain situations. Having a clear, concise game plan is important in writing clean and efficient code.

My understanding of these _____ has helped me with my communication between different teams. Even though two departments may work on the same project, they do not understand the same concepts and the limitations the other party has. In the roles I have worked at before, I often acted as the bridge between two groups successfully. This is highlighted by my time at Aerojet Rocketdyne. One of the first projects I worked on there was on an electrical system used to power a future space mission. When I started working there, it was near the end of the project. I had to talk with component engineers and relay information over towards system engineers and vice versa. Although they worked on the same projects, their communication was very weak since they dealt with such different scopes. I recognized their weak communication and decided to double-check their designs to make sure that everything was properly made and functional. Upon reading their schematics and diagrams, I realized that the voltage for one of the parts was incorrect. Upon further investigation, I saw that the component was actually completely the wrong one. I brought this up to my manager at that time and he brought it up to both teams. They acknowledged that it was incorrect and we managed to fix the box with the right components required. My willingness to proofread the schematics of a slightly dysfunctional project team saved the company its contract and most likely the jobs of multiple engineers.




2. Your Journey into Programming
We recognize that there are many paths to programming and we’d like you to walk us through yours. Tell us what sparked your interest in becoming a programmer, why you decided to explore that interest, and how you grew your skills independently or formally (consider personal projects, volunteer work, bootcamps, courses, or professional roles). Tell us about the last technical topic you learned or are learning right now, and what your approach was. Beyond applying to this program, share how you plan to continue mastering coding and how this fits in to your longer term goals.  
For this question, we recommend between 500 and 800 words.

Ever since I was a child, I loved technology. I fondly remember sitting in front of my Windows 98 computer playing *Neopets* with my sister in our dimly lit study room. I grew up loving computers and video games and spent many hours on them. In highschool, I decided to take a computer science class to better understand how video games and computers worked. However, this class was detrimental to my passions. The course was introductory and thus its scope was extremely limited. I learned conditional statements, loops and basic object oriented programming, but since I could not mentally connect the things I was learning to my passions, I felt that coding was a chore. However, I was still interested in technology, so out of highschool I decided to major in Electrical Engineering. One of the first courses I took was an introductory C++ course. The final project was a very simple dungeon puzzle game using object oriented programming. I had so much fun building the game from scratch and thinking of creative ways to create unique traps and puzzles. After that class, I was condering switching into computer science but because of the sunk cost fallacy, I decided to stay with Electrical Engineering. However, I was still interested in software so I decided to focus on Digital Signal Processing which combined major facets of both Hardware and Software. In these courses, I found how powerful software could be. I could manipulate any image, video or audio however I wanted. I soon began to study more computer science topics in my free time and became extremely interested in web development. Out of college, I took a hardware engineering job where I designed and built robots. However, I never had the same passion for building hardware as I did developing software. At nights, after work, I would work on small website projects using rudimentary HTML, CSS and JavaScript. After every single project, no matter how small, I would have a sense of accomplishment that I never got from hardware projects, no matter the scale. I decided to pursue this passion, left my job and attended the coding bootcamp App Academy up in San Francisco. Here, I properly learned the fundamentals of web development. I learned how to setup databases, link together the backend and frontend and create a clean and beautiful UI/UX. Many people look down upon bootcamps but I feel that the experience was rewarding and invaluable.

Recently, I have been learning Python when I am not studying for interviews. Python is currently one of the most prevalent languages in the industry and I believe that it will help my job search. Like most engineers, I learn new topics much better by doing, not watching or reading. However, I know the importance of having a strong foundation before tackling a question or issue. So, when I started learning Python, I purchased a course online that went over the fundamentals of Python and studied it closely. I'm glad I did as the course covered python-specific funtionalities like decorators, iterators and generators. After acquiring a firm base of knowledge, I've used Python for any new problems or projects that I work on.
