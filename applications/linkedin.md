1. Your Personal Story and Impact  
At LinkedIn, we strive for a culture that embraces and represents diverse ways of thinking, background, and approaches to solving the world’s problems. We act as owners taking active and creative leadership roles in solving the problems we encounter. Tell us about yourself and how your unique experiences and background shape the point of view you will bring to LinkedIn. Describe a time when you have taken initiative to try solving a problem (in this case not a coding problem) that has positively impacted another person, community, team, or organization. 
For this question, we recommend between 400 and 700 words.

As an ex-hardware engineer, I’ve built systems of all sizes. I’ve worked with the minute in transistors and microcontrollers and the gigantic in spacecraft and robots. Thus, I know the impact each individual component has on the whole. Likewise, I know the importance of understanding how the complete system works before working on its subsystems. 

My understanding of these _____ has helped me with my communication between different teams. Even though two departments may work on the same project, they do not understand the same concepts and the limitations the other party has. In the roles I had before

My ability to discern the difference between these two scales was vastly important at my time at Aerojet Rocketdyne. I have had to talk with component engineers and relay information over towards system engineers and vice versa. Although they work on the same projects, they do not speak the same language most of the time. 



2. Your Journey into Programming
We recognize that there are many paths to programming and we’d like you to walk us through yours. Tell us what sparked your interest in becoming a programmer, why you decided to explore that interest, and how you grew your skills independently or formally (consider personal projects, volunteer work, bootcamps, courses, or professional roles). Tell us about the last technical topic you learned or are learning right now, and what your approach was. Beyond applying to this program, share how you plan to continue mastering coding and how this fits in to your longer term goals.  
For this question, we recommend between 500 and 800 words.
3. Your Coding Talent
Every engineer at LinkedIn writes code. Part of our evaluation process for this program is to understand your coding ability. Tell us about coding projects that you’ve completed in the past or are currently working on. You can share links to code you’ve written, a product or website you’ve built, an open source project you’ve contributed to, and/or your favorite problem that you’ve solved. In addition to your examples, please tell us about what interesting challenges you faced, any gaps in knowledge you had to bridge, or new frameworks or data structures you utilized to solve a problem. Where possible, please include independent or solo projects where we can see your direct contributions.  If your examples include group work, please describe your individual contribution to the project. 
For this question, we recommend at least 400 words, but please use as many words as you need so that we fully understand your coding examples.
Note: We would like to see your actual code, but if you can’t share a link to the code that you’ve written, please make sure to describe the project in detail and give us as much information as you can about the project.  We’ll need to understand your project without seeing the code, so please help us to do that. Any media you’d like to include needs to link out with a URL (youtube, github, vimeo, etc.).
